# Final Presentations 

**4pm to 7pm, Thursday June 10th** (original finals slot)

Here is the point percentage breakdown for grading that the TAs and I plan to use for the “Final Product” 40% of the course grade.

* 15% Presentation
* 5% Idea, and Idea Refinement
* 25% Functionality, Quality (Reliability & Polish)
* 10% Technical Difficulty Implemented
* 20% Implementation
* 15% Design Process
* 10% Manual 

We will cross-reference against a ranking obtained from an overall quartiling judgment averaged among the evaluators.

Each group will have up to 10 minutes for a prepared presentation video submitted two days prior.

This will be followed by 10 minutes of live exploration of the app
by the teaching team, plus questions. Each member of the group should be
available for the question session.

The ten minute video presentation should include a demo (functionality, similar to what was done in the MVP video), as well as a discussion of
technical matters.

**Technical matters to cover:**
* Authorization and Authentication (if applicable)
* Database technologies used (if applicable)
* External APIs or libraries used (if applicable)
* Setup needed for app (configuration to get up a running instance.)
* Optional: Testing strategies (unit test, integration test, end-to-end tests). Since this wasn't a major focus point in this course, solid testing strategies are simply a bonus this quarter.


**Additional Notes:**
* Presentations will be in a Zoom session to which the entire class is invited.
* While the entire class is invited to watch the entire session, you are only
  responsible for attending the portion when your team is presenting.
* Presentations will be recorded.  The recording will only be viewed
  by course staff for purposes of evaluation.

The final presentation will be part of a holistic review of the team's
final product, including the presentation, as well as the team's production
implementation, and the code in its repo.

Various factors will include:

* Prepared Presentation: Clarity and content of presentation
* Question and Answer session: Clarity and content of answers
* App Functionality:
  - Suitability for purpose: How well does the app address the user's needs?
  - Challenge: Did the group take on a challenging problem or a very simple one?  
* User Interface:
  - Is the user interface easy to use, or challenging to figure out?
  - Is the user interface consistent? (e.g. user interface elements are nicely aligned rather than weirdly and haphazardly placed on the screen.)
  - Is the user interface pleasing to the eye?
* Testing Strategies (this wasn't a required focus this quarter):
  - Is there a documented test strategy linked to from the README.md file?
  - Does the test strategy include unit, integration and end-to-end testing?
  - How extensive is the test coverage?
* Review of Code
  - Does the code have a clear structure?
  - Is the code DRY?
  - Are names (variables,functions,components,methods,classes) clear and
    appropriate?
* Software Process
  - How often do issues have clear acceptance criteria and user stories?
  - How often are PRs linked to issues and vice-versa?
  - Are the explanation in PRs clear?
  - Are the commit messages clear?
