## Finalizing your demo (MVP video)

* Plan a five minute presentation video
* Please prepare a 5 minute YouTube video (unlisted or public, your choice)
  - See the bottom of the [lab02](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lab/lab02/) description for information about creating your MVP video.
  - Links to videos will be made available to (some of) the class for peer review, but will not be made public
* Present to an audience of **potential users**
  - Not to an audience of CS148 students, or the instructor or TAs.
  - Explain what problem the app solves, or what need it fulfills, as you demo the features of
    the app.
* Stay focused on user functionality.
  - Do not go into details of implementation, or team process.
  - There will be other presentations for that.
* Optionally, you may introduce with a powerpoint slide, and/or close with one, but the bulk
  of the time, you should be sharing your screen and showing us your app.
* At the end, tell us a bit about upcoming features planned for the next iteration.

At next week's Tuesday lecture [lect10](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lectures/lect10/) you'll be asked to evaluate other teams' presentation(s), so plan to watch them and be ready to do some very brief writing after each one.

## Point us to your video
*  create a file `team/MVP_DEMO.md` containing your MVP video link and any additional information you see fit that you think doesn't belong in the project's README.md  

## Add Installation instructions to your README.md (see [lab03](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lab/lab03/))
