# Procedure for Second Retro

# Today: Retrospective

You already know the goal and procedure for Retrospectives from your RETRO_01. This Retrospective allows you to discuss things that 

* We'll put you in breakout groups.
* When you are finished, just leave.
  * No need to come back to main room, unless you have questions
* Staff will be dropping in to observe.

# Deliverable

* In your team's repo, under `team` directory
  `team/RETROS.md`

* Add a section:

  ```
  # Retro #2 05/06/21 or 05/07/21

  * Led by: name-goes-here
  * Present: name1, name2, ... , nameN
  * Absent: name1, name2, ...

  ## Action item

  * a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
  * a change: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
  * a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team acheive the goal, or move closer to it.

  ## Optional

  * Record anything else you think the team might want to remember from this retro

  ```

* After the Retro

  All Team members: Fill out peer eval survey (on email from CATME.org)
  
  Retro leader: add a file `RETRO_02.md` to `team/retrospectives`
  
  ```
  ## Retro Assessment

  * A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
