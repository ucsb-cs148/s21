# Announcements
* MVP video demonstrations with peer eval 

# Get Ready

We will play your MVP videos in this (random) order: 

T8 - bike-map
T3 - course-recommender
T7 - file-transfer
T1 - rec-cen
T4 - community-based-map
T6 - ucsb-poll
T2 - food-bank
T5 - we-connect

Everyone will take notes and submit a quick peer-feedback form on each presentation. 
Here is the [review form](https://forms.gle/qYhNsWE88mXLt3VNA) that everyone should fill out while watching the presentations during class. 

After each video presentation, a representative from *the next group up* (or the first group, T8, in case of the last presentation) will ask a question to the team whose video was just shown. That question should be typed in the Zoom chat (so that we capture it) and read out by the representattive for the team asking the question. The question can be of any type, e.g. a follow-up on something that was not entirely clear, a low-level implementation question, a question about possible future functionality, or a high-level question about the product landscape connected to the project. 

After the peer team asked their question, there will be an opportunity for anyone to ask a question to the team whose video was shown, but if there are many questions, we may have to cut it short. We ask that any questions that are asked be captured in the Zoom chat! We also may chime in with questions and comments from the teaching team. 

After all 8 project videos have been shown, everyone will be asked to vote for their top-three favorite MVPs. We will announce the audience choice award winner for best MVP on Thurday in class (which gives you bragging rights, but no influence on your grades. Grades will solely be based on final product presentations and quality).  

# Celebrate

The remaining time in today's lecture, we will spend in team breakout rooms with your mentors and instructors dropping in to **celebrate** with you on how far you have already come - We are really proud and excited about every single team's progress since the start of the quarter. It's a journey, and we might as well enjoy it!
