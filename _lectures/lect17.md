* Prepare Product Peer Review (in [lab08](https://ucsb-cs148.github.io/s21/lab/lab08/))
  * Please select and list contact persons for the upcoming peer review [in this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGk06L3xZ08sWqDN3o_FKx8b-mQrxYGO_mrf6XcW0vA/edit?usp=sharing)
  * You can already start the first Step for lab08: 

# Step 1: Prepare FEEDBACK Repo and grant access to your reviewers

As a team, you will be preparing a new private Github Repo in which the team that evaluates your work will collect their feedback for you. 
This repo should have the name of your main team repo, followed by `DEPLOY_FEEDBACK`.

For instance:

* 1pm-t3-course-recommender-DEPLOY-FEEDBACK
* 1pm-we-connect-DEPLOY-FEEDBACK
* etc.  

This new repo is private.   You will need to:
* grant write access to your team's `-DEPLOY-FEEDBACK` repo to all members from the other team in your section that is reviewing your repo
* obtain write access to the other team's repos for each person on your team that is participating in a review

Here is a [table with the slack display names of all team members](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnGP-2nbP-HI3eNsd3Nc8gkpL8mAMNjratRvxIAI-gs/edit?usp=sharing).

To grant access you'll need the github id's of the folks from the other team (which you can obtain
using the `/whois @ScreenName` command on the course Slack.)   

Please communicate with the other team through Slack. Contact persons for each team will be listed [in this table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGk06L3xZ08sWqDN3o_FKx8b-mQrxYGO_mrf6XcW0vA/edit?usp=sharing) and you can Slack DM with them to coordinate. 

To grant access, you visit the `Settings` Page of the repo, then `Manage Access` (url is `/settings/access`).
